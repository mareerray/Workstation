Let’s break down the steps into smaller, more manageable parts with simple explanations. This will help you grasp each concept without feeling overwhelmed.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Go Environment

### 1. Install Go
- **What to Do**: Go to the [Go installation page](https://go.dev/doc/install) and follow the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Why**: You need Go installed to write and run Go programs.

### 2. Create a Project Directory
- **What to Do**:
  - Open your terminal (Command Prompt, Terminal, etc.).
  - Type the following commands:
    ```bash
    mkdir text_tool
    cd text_tool
    ```
- **Why**: This creates a folder called `text_tool` where you will keep all your project files.

### 3. Initialize a Go Module
- **What to Do**: Inside the `text_tool` directory, type:
    ```bash
    go mod init text_tool
    ```
- **Why**: This sets up a new Go module, which helps manage your code and dependencies.

## Step 2: Understand the Project Requirements

### 1. Read the Requirements
- **What to Do**: Carefully read through the project description again.
- **Why**: Understanding what your program needs to do is crucial before you start coding.

**********//// write a program that receive (as arguments) 
1. the name of  file containing a text that needs some modifications (the input)
2. the name of the file the modified text should be placed in (the output)
**********//// possible modifications that this program should execute:
The instructions provided outline a series of text formatting rules that can be applied to modify sentences in specific ways. Here's a simplified explanation of each rule:

1. **Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion**: Replace any hexadecimal number (indicated by "(hex)") with its decimal equivalent. For example, "1E (hex) files were added" becomes "30 files were added."

2. **Binary to Decimal Conversion**: Replace any binary number (indicated by "(bin)") with its decimal equivalent. For instance, 
"It has been 10 (bin) years" changes to 
"It has been 2 years."

3. **Uppercase Conversion**: Convert the word before "(up)" to uppercase. For example, 
"Ready, set, go (up)!" becomes 
"Ready, set, GO!"

4. **Lowercase Conversion**: Convert the word before "(low)" to lowercase. For example, 
"I should stop SHOUTING (low)" becomes 
"I should stop shouting."

5. **Capitalization**: Capitalize the first letter of the word before "(cap)." For example, 
"Welcome to the Brooklyn bridge (cap)" becomes 
"Welcome to the Brooklyn Bridge."

6. **Punctuation Formatting**: Adjust spacing around punctuation marks (., ,, !, ?, :, ;) so that they are close to the preceding word but have a space from the following word. For example, 
"I was sitting over there ,and then BAMM !!" changes to 
"I was sitting over there, and then BAMM!!". 
Special cases like "... or !?" are preserved.

7. **Single Quotes Formatting**: Ensure that single quotes around a word have no spaces between them and the word itself. If there are multiple words, place the quotes next to each corresponding word without spaces. For example, 
"I am exactly how they describe me: ' awesome '" becomes 
"I am exactly how they describe me: 'awesome'."

8. **Article Usage**: Change "a" to "an" if the following word starts with a vowel sound or an 'h'. For example, 
"There it was. A amazing rock!" becomes 
"There it was. An amazing rock!"

These rules provide a systematic approach to modifying text for clarity and consistency in formatting.



### 2. Identify Modifications Needed
- **What to Do**: Write down each modification you need to implement (like converting hex to decimal, changing case, fixing punctuation).
- **Why**: This will serve as a checklist when you start coding.

1. **Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion**: Replace any hexadecimal number (indicated by "(hex)") with its decimal equivalent. For example, "1E (hex) files were added" becomes "30 files were added."

2. **Binary to Decimal Conversion**: Replace any binary number (indicated by "(bin)") with its decimal equivalent. For instance, 
"It has been 10 (bin) years" changes to 
"It has been 2 years."

3. **Uppercase Conversion**: Convert the word before "(up)" to uppercase. For example, 
"Ready, set, go (up)!" becomes 
"Ready, set, GO!"

4. **Lowercase Conversion**: Convert the word before "(low)" to lowercase. For example, 
"I should stop SHOUTING (low)" becomes 
"I should stop shouting."

5. **Capitalization**: Capitalize the first letter of the word before "(cap)." For example, 
"Welcome to the Brooklyn bridge (cap)" becomes 
"Welcome to the Brooklyn Bridge."

6. **Punctuation Formatting**: Adjust spacing around punctuation marks (., ,, !, ?, :, ;) so that they are close to the preceding word but have a space from the following word. For example, 
"I was sitting over there ,and then BAMM !!" changes to 
"I was sitting over there, and then BAMM!!". 
Special cases like "... or !?" are preserved.

7. **Single Quotes Formatting**: Ensure that single quotes around a word have no spaces between them and the word itself. If there are multiple words, place the quotes next to each corresponding word without spaces. For example, 
"I am exactly how they describe me: ' awesome '" becomes 
"I am exactly how they describe me: 'awesome'."

8. **Article Usage**: Change "a" to "an" if the following word starts with a vowel sound or an 'h'. For example, 
"There it was. A amazing rock!" becomes 
"There it was. An amazing rock!"

## Step 3: Plan Your Functions

### 1. List Functions You Need
- **What to Do**: Write down the functions you will create:
  - `readFile`: To read input from a file.
  - `writeFile`: To save output to a file.
  - `processContent`: To apply all modifications.
  - Modification functions (like `convertHexToDecimal`, etc.).
- **Why**: Planning helps you organize your thoughts and code structure.

## Step 4: Write Your Code

### 1. Create a New Go File
- **What to Do**: Create a file named `main.go` in your `text_tool` directory.
- **Why**: This is where you will write your main code.

### 2. Start with the Main Function
- **What to Do**: Copy this basic structure into `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    // Code will go here later
}
```
- **Why**: This sets up your program with necessary imports and defines the main function where execution starts.

## Step 5: Implement Each Function

### 1. Reading and Writing Files
#### Read File Function
- **What to Do**: Add this function below `main()`:

```go
func readFile(filename string) (string, error) {
    file, err := os.Open(filename) // Open the file
    if err != nil {
        return "", err // Return error if there's an issue
    }
    defer file.Close() // Ensure file closes after reading

    var content strings.Builder // Use strings.Builder for efficient string concatenation
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file) // Create a scanner for reading lines
    
    for scanner.Scan() { // Read each line of the file
        content.WriteString(scanner.Text() + "\n") // Append line to content
    }
    
    return content.String(), scanner.Err() // Return content and any error encountered
}
```
- **Why**: This function reads all text from an input file and returns it as a string.

#### Write File Function
- **What to Do**: Add this function:

```go
func writeFile(filename string, content string) error {
    return os.WriteFile(filename, []byte(content), 0644) // Write content to output file
}
```
- **Why**: This function saves modified text into an output file.

### 2. Processing Content Function
#### Process Content Function
- **What to Do**: Add this placeholder function:

```go
func processContent(content string) string {
    // Apply all modifications here in order (we'll fill this out later)
    
    return content // For now, just return unmodified content 
}
```
- **Why**: This function will eventually handle applying all modifications to the text.

## Step 6: Implement Modification Functions

### Example of a Modification Function

#### Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal Function
- **What to Do**: Add this function:

```go
func convertHexToDecimal(input string) string {
    // Logic for converting hex numbers goes here (we'll fill this out later)
    
    return input // For now, just return unmodified input 
}
```
- **Why**: You’ll eventually implement logic here that finds hexadecimal numbers in the text and converts them.

### Repeat for Other Modifications
- Follow similar steps for other modifications like converting binary numbers, changing cases, fixing punctuation, etc.

## Step 7: Testing Your Code

### Run Your Program with Sample Input

1. Create a sample input file (`sample.txt`) in your project directory with test sentences.
2. In your terminal, run:
   ```bash
   go run . sample.txt result.txt
   ```
3. Check if `result.txt` contains expected modifications based on your input.

## Step 8: Write Unit Tests

### Create Test Cases

1. Create a new file called `main_test.go` in your project directory.
2. Add tests for each modification function:

```go
package main

import "testing"

func TestConvertHexToDecimal(t *testing.T) {
    // Define test cases here and check expected outcomes.
}
```

3. Run tests using:
   ```bash
   go test
   ```

## Conclusion

By breaking down each step into smaller tasks, it should be easier for you to understand what needs to be done at each stage of your project. Take it one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to ask for help if you get stuck on any part! Happy coding!
